            <h1><b>Can't Help Myself</b></h1>
            <p class="para1">In 2019’s <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en">Venice Art Biennale</a>,
                May You Live in Interesting Times, <a
                    href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/art/2019/partecipants/sun-yuan-and-peng-yu%C2%A0">Sun Yuan and
                    Peng Yu</a>’s robotic machine arm installation, Can’t Help
                Myself, is presented. In the central part of one of many exhibition rooms
                in Venice Biennale, Giardini, a huge exhibit is placed. This large installation is installed inside a
                transparent cage with a pure white color environment and cold white lighting. On the floor, there is
                deep red liquid flooding all around. The device itself is an industrial robot that turns and contracts
                continuously, and it is programmed in advance to control the movement of the mechanic arm to restrain
                the thick, viscous, blood-like liquid in a certain area. It is using a humorous and absurd display with
                an endless, repetitive robot to convey the contemporary views surrounding migration and sovereignty. The
                bloodstain-like marks that accumulate around it evoke the violence that results from surveilling and
                guarding border zones. Such visceral associations call attention to the consequences of authoritarianism
                guided by certain political agendas that seek to draw more borders between places and cultures and to
                the increasing use of technology to monitor our environment. Through this piece, the artists are
                observing the increasingly automated and industrialized global condition of advanced technology which is
                used in territories control. They are criticizing the relationship between machines and humans and also
                the relationship between humans and humans through mechanized reality.
            </p>

            <p class="para2">The main structure of the robotic arm is a Kuka industrial robot along with stainless
                steel and rubber. The dark red fluid spilling on the floor is cellulose ether in colored water. For
                the detection system, the artists used Cognex visual-recognition sensors and pre-programmed software
                to perceive and control the range of the “blood” on the floor and the movement of the arm. As for
                the outer structure, a lighting grid is attached to the ceiling and the transparent room is made of
                acrylic walls with aluminum white frames. The size of the entire installation is 710 x 710 x 500 cm,
                similar to a small room. The white color and the solid materials of steel and acrylic with straight
                lines and geometric composition create an environment identical to a hospital or a jail, giving the
                sense of the future, order, and the theme of utopia. The arm is isolated in a transparent room, and
                the viewers are observing outside as if it is separated from the crowd, accomplishing its work
                lonely and uninterrupted.
            </p>

            <p class="para3">When first entering the room, this industrial arm is the most eye-catching object.
                Audiences stand
                around the large acrylic “box”, watching the gigantic robot moving restlessly, whirring and collecting
                the bloody liquid. With the “blood” constantly oozing away, the sensors are triggered and prompting the
                arms to shovel the liquid back to a circular area. There are 32 different performances pre-programmed to
                the arm, making it spin, rotate, lift, bend, “scratch an itch,” “bow and shake,” or even “ass shake”
                which make it more humanoid with uncanny, and confusing actions. The sound made by the movements of the
                joints and inside the machine feels like it is mourning and breathing. Following the moves of the
                machinery, the red “blood” splashes to the wall and the machine itself, making it even scarier and more
                provocative. Each move is different with no specific sequence, and it just keeps moving and never stops.
            </p>

            <p class="para4">To finish this design, the artists started the concept of human relationships within
                society, the
                contradiction between human’s inherent nature and the order in networks. They considered that humans
                fear the unknown but they are also attracted by the stimulation of anticipating in the unknown future.
                Starting with simple sketches and built the smaller size prototype, they modified the design of the
                robot and collaborated with robotic engineers to refine it. After that, they assigned the manufacturer
                to produce the robot and tested multiple times for the best movements of the arm and the recipe of the
                fluid to achieve the ideal result.
            </p>

            <p class="para5">The artists introduce the conversation between viewers and the robot to consider whether
                the machine
                will eventually control the human or the human will still rule the machines. When the viewers are
                watching the piece, it evokes the contemplation of the moral issues between technology and humanity. Who
                will rule the world? The ideas about humanity and mechanization are conveyed through this lifeless
                object. By making the robot to sense and move, vitality is poured into a rigid machine. The non-living
                robot, therefore, has the ability to perform tasks as if it is alive and complete the wills of human
                species with its infinite endurance.
            </p>
